   Every Sketch that uses the PulseSensor Playground must
   define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS before including PulseSensorPlayground.h.
   Here, #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS false tells the library to
   not use interrupts to read data from the PulseSensor.

   If you want to use interrupts, simply change the line below
   to read:
     #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS true

   Set US_PS_INTERRUPTS to false if either
   1) Your Arduino platform's interrupts aren't yet supported
   by PulseSensor Playground, or
   2) You don't wish to use interrupts because of the side effects.

   NOTE: if US_PS_INTERRUPTS is false, your Sketch must
   call pulse.sawNewSample() at least once every 2 milliseconds
   to accurately read the PulseSensor signal.
